In my project for club's seminar, I used Docker to containerize the entire application and created some exercises for listeners. Because the exercises are designed to work in Docker containers, developing inside the containers environment is a must. 
Some of these works done are:
- Exec inside container and read a secret file
- Providen environment var to adjust the Docker running process
- Mapping ports and cheking results
- Using docker compose to connect frontend and backend together
